Project Title:

Informal waste picker logistics web application

Project Purpose:
Our group was tasked to develop a practical and impactful project that explores a real-world supply chain problem. We decided to delve into the environmental sector and this linked us directly to one of the major contributors to having clean communities, informal waste pickers. 
EcoConnect is about a community- driven company that wants to help informal waste pickers by transforming their work into a business. We wanted to make their labour- intensive days more convenient by providing services such as collection trucks and pick-up sites. 
Having these two services, informal waste pickers will be able to focus more on the financial aspect of their jobs and not need to worry where they would need to dispose of their daily collections. They will be able to have vehicles at convenient areas to collect the recyclable material and they will also have closer pick-up and drop off sites. 
We are also going to have a system by where the waste pickers can have a designated area of material retrieval and this will benefit them with a reduced amount of territorial disputes and create a chance of fairness for them. 

Database Schema:
Databases have been generated according to the ERD. Random data was generated to fill and complete the tables. 








Steps on how to run project:
1.	Home page will display three buttons. 
2.	Collection trucks will lead you to a page whereby a truck can be registered and this small form containing all the details will be sent to us. 
3.	This page also shows the pick-up locations for the trucks and also some statistics on how using our services will benefit the customer. 
4.	The next page can be accessed via the navigation bar and this can be the waste pickers page. 
5.	Here the informal waste picker can register as a member of the company by inserting all their personal information and also selecting a location. 
6.	 This page also includes pick up site locations and some statistics of informal waste pickers of South Africa. 
7.	The next page can be accessed via the navigation bar and this can be about us page. 
8.	Here is a small paragraph of EcoConnect as a company and our aim towards the community and informal waste pickers. 
9.	Pictures are also included in this page
