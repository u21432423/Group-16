                We are a community-driven recycling initiative that empowers informal waste pickers by transforming their essential work into a sustainable business. Our mission is to create cleaner, greener neighborhoods while providing fair income opportunities and dignity for those who collect and sort recyclable materials. By connecting waste pickers with recycling facilities and introducing eco-friendly practices, we turn everyday waste into valuable resources, building a circular economy that benefits both people and the planet.
